Chapter 3: brute-force approach
	CountSpecificSubStr. ch3.2 exer 9
		counting the number of substrings begnining and ending with a specified letter respectively within a given string. 
		e.g. CABAAXBYA has 4 substrs begining with letter A and ending with letter B.
		
	PartitionElements. ch3.4 exer 6
		partition n positive integers into two disjoint subsets with the same sum of their elements.
		e.g. {4,2,1,8,6,9} PART I:{6,9} PART II:{4,2,1,8}
