*All stuff contained is user-implemented algorithms depicted in the book Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and most of which can be considered as the candidates for solutions to exercises.

Chapter 3: brute-force approach
	CountSpecificSubStr. ch3.2 exer 9
		counting the number of substrings begnining and ending with a specified letter respectively within a given string. 
		e.g. CABAAXBYA has 4 substrs begining with letter A and ending with letter B.
		
	PartitionElements. ch3.4 exer 6
		partition n positive integers into two disjoint subsets with the same sum of their elements.
		e.g. {4,2,1,8,6,9} PART I:{6,9} PART II:{4,2,1,8}

chapter 4: divide-and-conquer algorithms
	FindLargeElePos. ch4.1 exer 1
		a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding a position of the largest element in an array of n numbers.
		
	FindLargestSmallestPair. ch4.1 exer 2
		divide-and-conquer/brute-force algorithms for finding both the largest and smallest elements in an arry.
		
	Exponent. ch4.1 exer 3
		compute a^n where a > 0 and n is a positive integer.
		
	BottomUpMergeSort. ch4.1 exer 10
		a bottom-up implementation of merge sort without recursions.
		
	PartRealNum. ch4.2 exer 8
		rearrange elements of a given array of n real numbers so that its negative elements precede all its positive elements.
		
	ArrangeDutchFlag. ch4.2 exer 9
		rearrange any array of characters R, W, and B, thus all R's come first, the W's come next, and the B's some last.
