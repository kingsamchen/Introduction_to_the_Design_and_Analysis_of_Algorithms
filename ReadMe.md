*All stuff contained is user-implemented algorithms depicted in the book Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and most of which can be considered as the candidates for solutions to exercises*

*For any other solutions to exercise, please see at http://sdrv.ms/WVfgNY*

*I have decided to stop providing remaining solutions due to some personal reasons*
